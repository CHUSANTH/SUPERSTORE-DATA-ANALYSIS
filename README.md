# SUPERSTORE-DATA-ANALYSIS

**Project Objective:**
A Superstore Giant wants to create a sales report to understand which products, regions, categories, and customer segments they should target or avoid.

**Key Technologies:**
1. Python Scripting
2. Google API
3. SQL
4. Streamlit
5. Data Collection

**Key Features of the Project:**
- Sales from the current to the previous year
- Sales from the current to the previous month
- Sales from the current to the previous quarter
- Sales by each product category (Pie Chart)
- Current sales vs previous year sales (Line Chart)
- Sales by each state (Filled Map)
- Profit from each sub-category of the products(Donut chart)

**Process Workflow**
1. **Data Loading:**
   - Loaded the dataset into Power BI.
     
2. **Data Transformation:**
   - Cleaned the data.
   - Checked for and handled missing values.
   - Performed other necessary transformations (e.g., creating calculated columns, removing duplicates).

3. **Data Modeling:**
   - Established relationships between tables to ensure seamless analysis.

4. **Data Transfer to SQL**
   - Transferred the cleaned and transformed data to an SQL database.

5. **Data Analysis in SQL:**
   - Performed various SQL queries to analyze sales, profit, and customer segments.

6. **Power BI Integration:**
   - Imported the SQL queries into Power BI.
   - Created a visually interactive dashboard to present insights.

**Dashboard Features**
 - KPIs to track year-over-year, month-over-month, and quarter-over-quarter sales performance.
 - Pie Chart to visualize sales distribution by product category.
 - Line Chart to compare current sales trends with the previous year.
 - Filled Map to analyze sales by different states.
 - Donut Chart to evaluate profit across different product sub-categories.

**Conclusion:**

This sales dashboard provides valuable insights into the performance of a Superstore Giant by analyzing key sales trends across time, product categories, and geographic regions. The use of KPIs, visualizations, and interactive elements enables stakeholders to make data-driven decisions on which products, regions, and customer segments to target or avoid. By leveraging SQL for data transformation and Power BI for visualization, this project demonstrates an efficient approach to sales analysis. Future enhancements could include more granular customer insights, predictive analytics, and deeper profitability analysis to further optimize business strategies.
